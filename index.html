          <p>Dr Pease is genuine caring and knowledgeable He takes his time even with the most challenging patients
            and believes in his patients His bedside manner is great Unlike most physicians today he does not rush you
            in and out He is down to earth and treats his patients with compassion even with the most challenging
            patients If your looking for a Dr who truly listens and also cares about what's going on in your personal
            life </p>

          <p>My husband my mother and I have all been patients of Dr Pease for many years as long as he's been in
            Worcester He listens explains treatments appropriately and doesn't over prescribe medications He is
            genuinely concerned about his patients and is very knowledgeable His wait time used to be long but it is
            much better lately His current staff are professional and do a great job

          <p>I love Dr Pease he is easy to talk to a real person I have been his patient for over 10 years I have had
            to wait to see him because he does run late because he takes is time to talk to his patients He is the
            best I have also had his wife cover once when he was out she is also awesome Out of all the other doctors
            I have ha din the past he is definitely the most personable

          <p>Dr Pease takes the time to listen to you to talk to you and to get the big picture of your life and your
            health He's a family doctor and he does very well with kids and adults He also isn't incined to give you a
            prescription just to get you out the door He'll tell you about treatment alternatives and give you the
            options and let you decide what to do He has a practical conservative approach preferring proven
            treatments rather than the latest unproven fads

          <p>Terrible I was trying pick up my boyfriend who is on crutches so he could get his knee looked at after a
            football injury as his friend had dropped him off at Dr Pease's for an appointment The doctor used his
            hands to literally shoo him away like an animal after already allowing him to book an appointment They
            then refused to let him use their phone to call me forcing him to sit in their office after so rudely
            dissmissing him Greedy greedy non compassionate Doctor Not a people person</p>
